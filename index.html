                <p>Some people are less fortunate; life is not kind to all of us. While you might be lucky enough to
                    live a comfortable life, others don’t have a roof over their head or food to put on the table. You
                    won’t be able to help everyone in need, but your gesture, no matter how small, will definitely make
                    a difference.</p>

            <p>Helping others is not always about giving them money or material things. It really doesn’t matter who you
                are or how much you have to offer. Be
                kind just for the sake of it and
                expect nothing in return.
